Technical Writing is the most underappreciated role in Software.

Think about it. It's not Sales and Marketing. Even though they are often reviled, they bring home the bacon.

It's not Product and Engineering either. They are releasing new features. Their value add is obvious.

It's not QA. At least they get Engineering resources. 

It's not Customer Success or Support. I say this with all love and respect, because I've done this job a lot. These folks are basically the janitors, cleaning up the messes left behind by everyone. They suffer for the bugs, they suffer for the miscommunication left by Sales and Marketing, and they suffer the affects of bad documentation :D

Once again, at least they get Engineering resources. When the house is going up in flames for support, everyone joins the bucket brigade.

Try getting an Engineering resource for documentation. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but it's not common. 

We often don't even get to pick our own Knowledge base, or authoring tools.     

And try asking for a budget. You've got one, it's called your SALARY.

No one's ever going to compliment you on a well done document, but wait till a link gets broken, or something's wrong.

The work done by Technical Writers underpins all these other areas. It explains the things the Engineers design. Sometimes it helps Sales and Marketing sell. It makes Customers more successful, and easier to support. If there's nothing going wrong, your writers are doing a great job.

Tell me I'm wrong. What do you think is the most underappreciated role in Software?
