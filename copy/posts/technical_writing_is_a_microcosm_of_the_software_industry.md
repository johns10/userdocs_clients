In the Software Industry, Technical Writing is a microcosm of the business. If you subscribe to the docs-as-product philosophy, you already beleive this. If you don't, you might consider it. It might make you more intentional in executing your function.

If you deploy your documentation docs-as-code style, you already practice this. If you don't, you might consider it. It might make you more technically capable.

When we are doing a documentation deployment, we are:

* Collecting requirements from our business and users
* Deciding on the structure and design of information and documentation
* Picking products, or code frameworks to deploy our documentation on
* Designing and creating large amounts of content to deploy on the system
* Configuring, or coding the system
* Supporting the system
* Managing large and small projects to deploy content, improve the system, improve processes, and support users

This is very similar to what I'm doing to create the Userdocs product, but at a different scale, and with a different purpose.

Think about your documentation system as a product. 
It will help you contextualize the work you are doing. 
It will give each task bigger purpose. 
It will help you understand the value of your work to your career and to your business.
If you're working on Confluence, or Google Docs, think of it like building a product on a no-code platform.

You can use Technical Writing to build skills that will help you understand the business as a whole, and grow your career and capabilities.
