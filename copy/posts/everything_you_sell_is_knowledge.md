You don't sell a product or a service. You sell knowledge. That knowledge forms a solution that solves a problem. That solution might be software, a physical product, or a service.

"If tech writing doesn't tell the story of why they have a problem and how the software solves that problem, then tech writing is not doing its job." - @daryl white

As a technical writer, I've spent most of my time documenting products, primarily for practical purposes. I spent time documenting how to do things, or how things work to keep support and implementation from answering the same question over and over again. This writing saved the company a lot of time. It helped customers be more successful with products.

Given this framework of knowledge, I've been documenting the solution, not the problem or the knowledge that's used to solve it.

Problem -> Knowledge -> Solution -> Documentation

Even though it's a bit harsh to digest Daryl's statement, I think he's right. I think I've failed to do my job by not drilling back into the problem we solve, or the knowledge we use to solve it.

Whatever I write about in the future, I'm going to focus more on the problems we solve as a business. I'm going to document the knowledge we have that makes our company and solution unique.

I hope that you can also find a way to drill in to what makes your business unique, and use it to improve the quality of the documentation you produce.
