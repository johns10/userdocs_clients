Here's a way to get out of the hole if you get depressed.

I've suffered from chronic depression for over 25 years. 

I've been in the hole many times, and I've found a pretty effective way of getting out.

Depression is an insidious disease. It's like a sentient being living inside of you that seeks to get you depressed, and keep you there. It's self-perpetuating and has many strategies to keep you from living a happy fulfilling life.

One of those strategies is embarrassment. Depression makes you feel embarrassed and weak, because it's all in your head. Logically, it's something you should be able to tackle on your own.

News flash: it's not. Coping with depression is a team sport, and embarrassment is a key tool that it uses to keep you from enlisting teammates who can help keep you live a happy and fulfilling life.

One of the really helpful, but completely inactionable peices of advice people give to the depressed is "talk to someone about it." The problem with this advice is that depressed people know this. They'd do it, but they are completely embarrassed about their situation. Another major symptom of the disease is a complete lack of desire to do mentally healthy things like socializing. This lack of desire, and the embarrassment of having the disease to begin with make this a very difficult task when you're in the hole.

The way to get out of the hole is to convince yourself that it's ok to be depressed. Remind yourself that around 5% of the worlds population have depression (that's about 1 in 20 people). If it's your first time, remember that some of us have had it our entire adult lives. It's a normal, albeit uncomfortable place to be for us.

If you're depressed you probably know you need to do this: tell people you're depressed. You won't be able to do it until you convince yourself that it's normal and acceptable to be that way. When you do, it shines a little light on that garbage monster. Take it from someone who's been there hundreds of times: the garbage monster hates light.

If you need to tell someone who will be totally accepting, won't judge you, and has no ability to affect your social or professional life, DM me. Trust me: I'll understand and won't judge you.
