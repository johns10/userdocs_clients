Technical Writing is one of the most diverse roles in technology. Technical writers are often responsible for documenting customer-facing and internal systems and processes. 

Technical writing often involves:

* Working with products in a very early state. We aren't testers, but we do a little testing.
* Meeting and talking with customers, engineers, product managers, support and customer success.
* Researching existing and new technologies.
* Reviewing the useability of products and processes. We aren't UX designers, but we help with it.
* Configuring the product/environment, so you understand it and document it properly.
* Organizing and architecting information about products.
* Configuring or programming documentation systems.
* Reviewing, Editing and Publishing documentation.
* Developing visual content like screenshots, drawings, diagrams and videos.
* Sometimes, we even do a little writing. We produce how-to guides, reference material, product breifs, white papers, blog posts and more.

What else are you doing as a technical writer, that's not on this list?
