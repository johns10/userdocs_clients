# Features

## Interactive Authoring

Create processes to automatically collect screenshots from your application. Step through processes to debug them, or run them to ensure they execute completely in real time. Assemble your steps and processes into jobs, intended for execution in CI/CD and test your entire automated workflow before deploying.

## Automated Annotations

Creates and applies annotations to your web app automatically. With UserDocs Web, there's no need to manually add boxes or badges to your images. These can be added easily as part of the screenshot automation process.

## Annotation Styling

Enter injectable CSS into your team's settings. This CSS will be injected on the page during automation. All annotations will be styled according to your CSS, reducing the need to enter unnecessary data in your process.

## Process Health Monitoring

Reports the health of each job, process, and step in the application. Use the processes menu to get a summary of the status of each process, based on the status of the last 5 executions. The status report will pinpoint the exact step that failed, and the stack trace of the failure, so you can quickly diagnose and fix the root cause of the problem. This process status report integrates with the CI/CD application. Automated and interactive executions will be reported in the UserDocs application.

## Project and Version Management

Organize your team's projects, versions, and processes. Maintain separate projects to represent applications, customer projects, or development efforts. Maintain different versions of each project to maintain screenshot collection processes for older or upcoming versions of your projects.

## Screenshot Diffs

UserDocs Web diffs each screenshot it collects from your application against the current image. If it finds a difference, it displays a warning in the application. Clicking the warning will open an approval workflow, displaying the original, provisional, and diff of the two images. This gives technical writers an opportunity to quickly identify UI changes, and approve them before the new screenshot replaces the old one.

## AWS Integration

Integrates to AWS, and stores images in your bucket. Enter your AWS credentials and bucket name. UserDocs will use your AWS bucket to manage back-end image storage.
