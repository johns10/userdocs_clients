The 'outline' annotation type typically places an outline around the element to annotate. Outlines indicate a single element on the page that needs explanation. Place outlines in conjunction with badges when several items need explanation, but the user should take a single action on the page.

The 'badge' annotation type uses the [locator and the outline element](annotation_placement.md) to place an outline around the target element. See an example of the outline in the following screenshot. 

To add an outline to a page, create an 'Apply Annotation' step, and select the 'Outline' annotation type.
