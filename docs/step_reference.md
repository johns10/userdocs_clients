# Steps

Steps describe individual actions taken in an automated browser. Each step has a type and several fields. The step type defines what action the step performs. The fields are parameters that modify how the step performs that action.

Steps can be executed individually in the UserDocs application. Steps can be added to a process and executed in sequence with other steps. Steps can also be added to jobs, and executed in sequence with other steps and jobs.
