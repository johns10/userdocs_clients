1. **Name** - A descriptive name of the element. Will be used in the UI, and in automatic naming schemes for the step.
2. **Strategy** - The strategy used to apply the selector. UserDocs supports CSS and xpath selectors.
3. **Selector** - The selector that UserDocs will use to locate the element.
4. **Transfer Selector** - This button will transfer the selector, automatically sent over from the automated browser from the 'Transferred Selector' element (designated by 8) into the selector field.
5. **Test Selector** - This button will highlight the selector in the automated browser window, to help you test your selector.
6. **Transferred Selector** - Displays the selector transferred over from the automated browser for review before transferring into the field.
