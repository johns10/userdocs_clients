# Documentation

All screenshots in our documentation are built with the UserDocs screenshot automation Suite. UserDocs documentation is written in markdown, and published using internally developed tools. Check out the source code for our documentation on the [userdocs_clients github](https://github.com/johns10/userdocs_clients/tree/main/docs). 

The goal of our documentation is to provide examples of how the UserDocs application suite can be to create high quality screenshots in docs-as-code style workflows. We hope you'll find inspiration and examples on how to save time and improve the quality of your own documentation.
